Title: Pharmacy Management System Project in Python with MySQL

Abstract:
Pharmacy management is an important aspect of healthcare that involves the efficient handling of pharmaceutical products, inventory management, sales, and other related tasks. Automating the pharmacy management system using Python programming language and MySQL database can streamline the workflow and improve the overall efficiency of the pharmacy operations. This project aims to develop a Pharmacy Management System using Python and MySQL, which includes functionalities such as managing inventory, handling sales, managing suppliers, generating reports, and providing user authentication and authorization.

Introduction:
Pharmacies are essential in the healthcare industry as they play a crucial role in providing medications and other pharmaceutical products to patients. Efficient management of pharmaceutical products, inventory, and sales is crucial to ensure smooth operations and provide quality patient care. Manual management of pharmacy operations can be time-consuming and error-prone, which can lead to issues such as stockouts, overstocks, and incorrect sales records. To overcome these challenges, a Pharmacy Management System can be developed using Python programming language and MySQL database, which can automate various tasks and improve the overall efficiency of the pharmacy operations.

Objectives:
The main objectives of the Pharmacy Management System project are as follows:

Develop a user-friendly interface for managing pharmacy operations such as inventory, sales, suppliers, and reports.
Implement functionalities for managing inventory, including adding new products, updating product information, managing stock levels, and generating alerts for low stock.
Implement functionalities for managing sales, including generating bills, managing customer information, handling discounts, and providing options for different payment methods.
Implement functionalities for managing suppliers, including adding new suppliers, updating supplier information, and managing supplier payments.
Implement functionalities for generating reports, such as sales reports, inventory reports, and supplier reports, to provide insights into the pharmacy's performance and make informed decisions.
Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access and perform actions in the system.
Develop a robust and scalable database using MySQL to store and manage the pharmacy data efficiently.
Methodology:
The Pharmacy Management System project will be developed using Python programming language and MySQL database. The system will be designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application logic into three components: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (handles user input and updates the Model and View). The system will be implemented using popular Python libraries such as tkinter for GUI development, pymysql for MySQL database connectivity, and pandas for data analysis and reporting.

The development process will follow the following steps:

Requirement Gathering: Gather requirements from the end-users and stakeholders to understand the needs and expectations from the Pharmacy Management System. This will involve discussions, interviews, and surveys to identify the functionalities and features that need to be included in the system.

System Design: Based on the gathered requirements, design the system architecture using the MVC pattern. Create a system flowchart, ER diagram, and user interface design to provide a clear picture of how the system will work and look.

Database Design: Design the database schema using MySQL, including creating tables, defining relationships, and setting up indexes. Normalize the database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.

Implementation: Develop the system using Python programming language and MySQL database. Implement the functionalities for managing inventory, sales, suppliers, reports, and user authentication and authorization. Create the user interface using tkinter library to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

Testing: Conduct thorough testing of the system to identify and fix any bugs or issues. Test the system for different scenarios, inputs, and outputs to ensure its reliability and accuracy.

Documentation: Prepare documentation for the Pharmacy Management System, including user manuals, installation guides, and technical documentation. Document the
